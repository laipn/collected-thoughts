## Truthiness

> "You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts."
> Daniel Patrick Moynihan

Debate and rhetoric often talk about the "truth" and "facts" without establishing what what determines a thing to be true or factual.  Consider the notion of: 

> "Truthiness is the belief or assertion that a particular statement is true based on the intuition or perceptions of some individual or individuals..."
> - ["Truthiness"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness)

Truthiness usually has certain negative connotations:

> "...without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts. Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended to sway opinions."

but, I think it's worth giving actual consideration to what makes a thing true or not.   Different examples:

Tautogical truths: Things that are true by the rules of formal logic. Examples: "A dog is a dog"
Axioms: Things that are true by definition. Examples: "A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.", "All men are created equal"
Mathematical truths: Things that are proved from axioms and formal logic: "(\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\))."
Scientific theory: Things that are true using scientific principles: "E=M*c^2",  Evolution, Efficient Market Hypothesis

Considering most debate is around scientific truths, it's useful to think about what makes a good scientific theory.  I assert that a good theory must:

1. [Falsfiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)
2. Explains various phenomena 

For example the theory of general relativity is falsifiable ([experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens) could have disproved it) and explains cosmic phenomena.  It however fails to explain phenomena at quantum scales.  String theory could explain both quantum and cosmic phenomena, but it is not a testable (falsifiable) theory.

"Theory of evolution" is [not very](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian_rabbit) falsifiable because it is difficult to conduct an experiment to disprove it.  However it does explain a lot of phenomena we see in fossil evidence. Creationism does not. 

It's important to understand these properties because it's also how a lot of people decide "truths" unrelated to science.  For example the assertion:
